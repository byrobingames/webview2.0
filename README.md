If you have already install a previous version (2.2 or lower) of Webview extension, you will see two extension in "Settings->Extensions". This is because of the renamed folder you just downloaded from GitHub.

- Disable the Webvies Extension thats not disabled (press red button "Disable")
- Close your Game
- Go to "YOURDOCUMENTFOLDER/stencylworks/engine-extensions/" folder
- Delete the folder "webview2.0" and leave the folder "webview2.0-master"(thats the new folder name)
- Open you Game
- You see now in Settings->Extensions, there is now jus one Webview extension.
- The blocks you already used with previous version subsist.

Or for advanced users:(Not recommended)
- Unzip webview2.0-master.zip you just download
- Rename folder from "webview2.0-master" to "webview2.0"
- Copy the webview2.0 folder and paste it in "YOURDOCUMENTFOLDER/stencylworks/engine-extensions/"
- You have to do this every time you download a updated version fom GitHub.
